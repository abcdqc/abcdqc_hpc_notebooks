# ABCDQC HPC Notebooks
## Introduction
This is one of the projects from the NCBI collaborative biodata science hackathon [http://biohackathons.github.io]. Our group is working on a project to automatically QC the [ABCD study data](https://data-archive.nimh.nih.gov/abcd). [Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SSinOI-IDNTdZreTARghN799z-Oi2Bn-H6-xFGCnIVc/edit?usp=sharing) is a copy of our initial presentation. 

This project is composed of three github repos ([abcdqc_webserver](https://github.com/abcdqc/abcdqc_webserver), [abcdqc_batchserver](https://github.com/abcdqc/abcdqc_batchserver), [abcdqc_hcp_notebooks](https://github.com/abcdqc/abcdqc_hpc_notebooks)) that work on two AWS instances and utilize the NIH high performance computing cluster. 

The notebooks in this repo in used in creating swarm jobs on the [NIH High Performance Compute (HPC) Cluster](http://hpc.nih.gov) to run the MRIQC jobs on the ABCD FastTrack data.

## Background
The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study will track approximately 10,000 nine- and ten-year-old children longitudinally throughout adolescence and early adulthood. Approximately half the enrolled participants were identified as likelier to engage in high risk behaviors and/or develop mental health problems during adolescence. It is the largest neuroimaging study of this type, and aims to track the arc of mental health development within a nationally-representative sample. Data are generated by 21 imaging centers throughout the United States, with imaging acquisitions and parameters optimized for better compatibility across 3T scanners. Imaging data include T1-, T2- and diffusion-weighted structural scans and functional MRI. Both resting state and task-based fMRI scans are collected (Casey et al., 2018).
